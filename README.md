# Bank_Transaction_Analysis_and_Fraud_Detection_Using_ML
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions to prevent financial losses.
Obtained dataset from Kaggle IEEE Competition then applied data preprocessing and performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
Splitted the dataset into training and testing sets and used various classification algorithms such as random forest, CatBoost and XGBoost to build the models.
Evaluated the models using Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve.

The repository has 7 files:
First 4 files are snapshot of the Power BI Dashboard
5th file is the Dataset Link from where the datasets for particular project can be downloaded.
6th file- transaction and identity datasets are merges in a single file based on transaction ID(Left Outer Join).
7th file is the Jupyter notebook file where entire project code is written.

Thanks!!!
